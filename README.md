# FFXIV Armoury Manager
This application is a personnal project aiming to simplify gear inventory management for [Final Fantasy XIV](https://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/). It aims to give users a place to have a centralized location where they can easily see all the gear their characters have in different location.

In a later version, it will have an option to display which piece of gear is equipable, or too low level, for characters.
# About
The application is currently in early alpha and is subject to change.
